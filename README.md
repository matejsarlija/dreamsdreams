A python API (flask)

HATEOAS RESTful API with a crapload of flaskful imports D:

It has no tests and no hardcoded DB data initialization. I had to do a lot of Postman requests.

What's left is one day to figure out how to sensibly combine an image and json in a single
outgoing response, without it being some kind of MIME.
